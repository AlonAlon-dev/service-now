**What can you say about the complexity of your code?**

The time complexity is O(n) when n is the input size.
The space complexity is O(n+m) when n is the input size and m is the number of patterns.

**How will your algorithm scale?If you had two weeks to do this task, what would you have done differently?
What would be better?**

My algorithm will scale perfectly.
This is because adding values to the map takes a constant time O(1).

I always write the best code I can, therefore I wouldn't change anything.
